<h4 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="fontstyle0"> Elvis is currently as post-doctoral fellow at US2B, Nantes University.
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="fontstyle0"> Previously, he was an Assistant Professor of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at Bombay College of Pharmacy and a computational chemist working on various drug discovery projects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="fontstyle0">After earning a bachelor’s degrees in Pharmacy from V.E.S. College of Pharmacy (University of Mumbai) in 2011, Elvis pursued a master’s degree in Pharmaceutical Chemistry at Bombay College of Pharmacy in 2014. He completed his PhD in Computational Chemistry under Prof Dr Evans Coutinho also at Bombay College of Pharmacy in 2019. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="fontstyle0">During his PhD, Elvis developed methods to understand drug-resistant mutations using computer simulations.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="fontstyle0">His current research is concerned primarily with molecular modelling techniques to understand chiral separation using cyclodextrins, enhancing drug loading to various cyclodextrin derivatives, molecular dynamics simulations to understand protein-ligand, protein-protein and<br />protein-nucleic acid interactions and QSAR modelling for leading optimization. He is keenly interested in employing free-energy calculations and enhanced sampling techniques to understand complex protein dynamics. </span></p>
