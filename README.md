<h4 style="text-align: center;">About Elvis</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="fontstyle0">Elvis is currently an Assistant Professor of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at Bombay College of Pharmacy and a computational chemist working on various drug discovery projects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="fontstyle0">After earning a bachelor’s degrees in Pharmacy from V.E.S. College of Pharmacy (University of Mumbai) in 2011, Elvis pursued a master’s degree in Pharmaceutical Chemistry at Bombay College of Pharmacy in 2014. He completed his PhD in Computational Chemistry under <a href="https://profeccoutinho.net.in">Prof Dr Evans Coutinho</a> also at Bombay College of Pharmacy in 2019. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="fontstyle0">During his PhD, Elvis developed methods to understand drug-resistant mutations using computer simulations.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="fontstyle0">His current research is concerned primarily with molecular modelling techniques to understand chiral separation using cyclodextrins, enhancing drug loading to various cyclodextrin derivatives, molecular dynamics simulations to understand protein-ligand, protein-protein and<br />protein-nucleic acid interactions and QSAR modelling for leading optimization. He is keenly interested in employing free-energy calculations and enhanced sampling techniques to understand complex protein dynamics. He has published 32 papers till date, which includes  3 book chapters. He has supervised 2 M.Sc. students for their dissertation projects. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="fontstyle0">Elvis also serves as an editorial board member and reviewer for various journals and evaluates papers submitted in the field of computational chemistry and bioinformatics.</span></p>
